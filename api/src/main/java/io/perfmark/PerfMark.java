   * <p>Unlike {@link #attachTag(String, String)}, this defers constructing the tagValue String
   * until later, and avoids doing any work while PerfMark is disabled. Callers are expected to
   * provide a method handle that can consume the {@code tagObject}, and produce a tagValue. For

   * following issues:
   *
   * <ul>
   *   <li>Callers should be careful to not capture the {@code tagObject}, and instead use the
   *       argument to {@code stringFunction}. This avoids a memory allocation and possibly holding
   *       the tagObject alive longer than necessary.
   *   <li>The {@code stringFunction} should be idempotent, have no side effects, and be safe to
   *       invoke from other threads. If the string function references state that may be changed,
   *       callers must synchronize access. The string function may be called multiple times for the
   *       same tag object. Additionally, if {@code attachTag()} is called with the same tag object
   *       and string function multiple times, PerfMark may invoke the function only once.
   *   <li>The tag object may kept alive longer than normal, and prevent garbage collection from
   *       reclaiming it. If the tag object retains a large amount of resources, this may appear as
   *       a memory leak. The risk of this memory increase will need to be balanced with the cost of
   *       eagerly constructing the tag value string. Additionally, if the string function is a
   *       capturing lambda (refers to local or global state), the function itself may appear as a
   *       leak.
   *   <li>If the stringFunction is {@code null}, or if it throws an exception when called, the tag
   *       value will not be attached. It is implementation defined if such problems are reported
   *       (e.g. logged). Note that exceptions are expensive compared to PerfMark calls, and thus
   *       may slow down tracing. If an exception is thrown, or if the stringFunction is {@code
   *       null}, PerfMark may invoke other methods on the tag object or string function, such as
   *       {@code toString()} and {@code getClass()}.
   * </ul>
