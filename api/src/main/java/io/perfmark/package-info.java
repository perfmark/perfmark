/**
 * PerfMark is a very low overhead tracing library, designed for in-process use. To use PerfMark,
 * see the docs on {@link io.perfmark.PerfMark}.
 *
 * <p>The PerfMark project is split into several, cohesive pieces, that allow users to selectively
 * include what they need. For users that want to add the tracing hooks into their application, but
 * not include the full implementation, only the {@code io.perfmark} package is needed. For
 * consuming the data, the {@code io.perfmark.tracewriter} package can be used to write to the
 * Chrome Trace Event format.
 *
 * <p>PerfMark includes several runtime-only dependencies that can be included for fast recording.
 * The library will attempt to load these packages if they are found on the classpath, falling back
 * if they are unavailable. To work properly, a <i>generator</i> and a <i>recorder</i> are needed.
 * Generators tell PerfMark if it is enabled or not. Recorders tell PerfMark how to store the data,
 * if it is enabled. The stable implementations are:
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li>
 *       <pre>io.perfmark.java9</pre>
 *       - a wait-free recorder and low-overhead generator. The recorder in this package has the
 *       lowest and most consistent amount of overhead. The generator in this package is not the
 *       fastest, but has low overhead to enable / disable.
 *   <li>
 *       <pre>io.perfmark.java7</pre>
 *       - a zero-overhead generator. The generator here is more efficient than the one in the
 *       <pre>io.perfmark.java9</pre>
 *       package, but has a high overhead to enable / disable it.
 *   <li>
 *       <pre>io.perfmark.java6</pre>
 *       - a blocking recorder and medium-overhead generator. This package is included as a safe
 *       fallback for when advanced VM features are unavailable, or when running on Android.
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>The overhead of tracing is very low in all implementations, and has been custom tailored for
 * no-allocation. See the documentation in README.md in the root directory for more info.
